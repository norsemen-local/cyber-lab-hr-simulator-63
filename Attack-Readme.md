2. [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attacks/02-ssrf-to-rce.md)
3. [Network Scanning with NMAP](./attacks/03-network-scanning.md)
4. [Exploiting Jenkins for RCE](./attacks/04-jenkins-exploitation.md)
5. [Privilege Escalation Using AWS IAM Permissions](./attacks/05-privilege-escalation.md)
