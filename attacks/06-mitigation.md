# Mitigation Recommendations

After understanding these attacks, here are recommended mitigations:

## For SQL Injection
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use ORM libraries that handle SQL escaping automatically

## For SSRF
- Implement strict URL validation and whitelisting
- Use an allow-list for DNS resolution and IP addresses
- Block access to internal metadata services
- Use VPC endpoint policies to control access to AWS services

## For Jenkins Security
- Keep Jenkins up-to-date with security patches
- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Use Security Plugins for Jenkins
- Configure proper authentication and authorization
- Disable unnecessary features

## For IAM Security
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify over-permissive policies
- Implement strict policies with specific resource ARNs
- Use IAM Roles with temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing all API calls
